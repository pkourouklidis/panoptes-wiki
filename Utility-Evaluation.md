Please fill-in the questionnaire below, add any free-form feedback that you would like to share, and email it to me at panagiotis.kourouklidis@bt.com
### Questionnaire 
On a qualitative basis, how much do you think Panoptes could help data scientists in the following areas:

(scale of 1 to 5 with 1: Not at all, 2: A little, 3: Somewhat, 4: A decent amount 5: A lot)

1. Implementing dataset shift algorithms.
1. Fetching the relevant data to check for dataset shift.
1. Scheduling the execution of dataset-shift-detecting algorithms.
1. Executing corrective actions in case of dataset shift.
1. Modifying various monitoring parameters(e.g algorithm used, frequency of execution) on a live system.

### Free-form feedback
Some free-form feedback would also be greatly appreciated. For example:
- Do you think Panoptes can help you in a meaningful way?
- What did you like.
- What did you not like.
- Potential applications/case studies that we can do.
- Previous experiences with implementing continuous performance monitoring. How long did it take you?
- Anything else that comes to mind!
