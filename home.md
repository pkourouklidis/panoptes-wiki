# What is Panoptes?
Panoptes is a low-code tool that helps data scientists safeguard the performance of deployed ML models against the various types of dataset shift. After the deployment of an ML model, there is no guarantee that incoming data will always follow the same statistical distribution as the data in the training set. Panoptes provides a way for data scientists to use the algorithm of their choice to detect dataset shift and trigger corrective actions if necessary.

To reduce the complexity of platform-specific technical details (e.g on-prem vs Google Cloud Platform), Panoptes provides a high-level view of the underlying platform used for the training, deployment, and monitoring of ML models. Data scientists can use Panoptes Description Language (PDL) to create a complete specification of how they would like their models to be monitored. This description is portable across platforms with Panoptes deployed. Data scientists can therefore focus on the core logic of the ML model monitoring rather than the technical implementation.
